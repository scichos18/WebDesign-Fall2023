        <h3>Horse Riding & Showing</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Riding a horse can definitely be intimidating and it takes a lot of practice, but these 
                <a href="https://horserookie.com/how-to-ride-a-horse-for-beginners/">basic riding tips</a>
                can help with safety, equipment, and confidence.</p></li>
            <li><p>Both of my horses are Appaloosas, which is a breed of horse, so a lot of the horse shows
                we attend are sponsored by the <a href="https://www.appaloosa.com/">Appaloosa Horse Club</a>.</p></li>
            <li><p>I often video my riding at horse shows so that I can improve in the future and look back at past shows.
                This is a video of me and Austin at a show in Monroe in September, 2022.</p>
